# MrPowers Book

This book is built with [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).

This book is hosted here: https://mrpowers.github.io/

## Deploy

Build the latest files with `mdbook build`.

Manually copy these files into the [mrpowers.github.io](https://github.com/MrPowers/mrpowers.github.io) repository.

Yea, I know, it's not a great deploy process :|

## Install

Download the `mdbook` binary.

Then manually open it, so you have permissions to run it on your Mac.

Add it to your path with a command like this so you can easily run the commands: `mv ~/Downloads/mdbook /Users/matthew.powers/.local/bin`.
